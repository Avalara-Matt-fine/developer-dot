<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<h3>Automate Excise Taxes with the Excise Tax API</h3>
The Excise Tax API allows you to automate tax for transactions involving motor fuels, petroleum products, and natural gas.
<h3>What You Can Do</h3>
Automating the process of identifying and calculating tax for financial transactions involving excise tax can be complex and difficult to maintain in-house. Avalara AvaTax Excise provides built-in support for thousands of jurisdictions in the U.S. and Canada.

The Excise Tax API is a SOAP web service that is the external programmatic interface into the <a href="https://www.avalara.com/products/avatax-excise/">Avalara AvaTax Excise application</a>. It provides for a platform-independent mechanism to obtain tax calculation information. This document defines the object structure, and an introduction on how to consume the web service for use in customer programs.
<h3>Get API Key</h3>
To get a username and password, contact your Customer Account Manager or email <a href="mailto:developer@avalara.com">developer@avalara.com</a>.
<h3>Documentation</h3>
