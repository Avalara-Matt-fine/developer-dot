The Avalara AvaTax SOAP API is designed to integrate with virtually any financial application,  e-commerce, point-of-sale, custom-built or other third-party application, whether it is written in PHP, Ruby, .NET, Java, or a COM-compliant language.  We maintain a number of <a href="/api-docs/api-sample-code">SOAP class libraries and samples</a> in addition to several REST samples. You may also use our <a href="https://development.avalara.net/tax/taxsvc.wsdl">Tax Service WSDL</a> and <a href="https://development.avalara.net/address/addresssvc.wsdl">Address Service WSDL</a> to develop your own wrappers.

For a full description of the SOAP API, take a look at the <a href="/wp-content/apireference/beta/#avatax-rest-api">SOAP API Reference</a>.
<h3>Making Direct SOAP Calls</h3>
If you are able to utilize pre-compiled 3rd-party adapters (.dll, .jar, etc.) in your environment, it is usually easier to use one of the above mentioned libraries and samples. If your environment or preference requires you to create your own web service client, we recommend using a local copy of the WSDL to keep the service static in your application in the event that we update the WSDL in ways that no longer work with your application code. When we make these changes, we do post service notifications in the admin console and via email to allow you to review the changes and decide when and if you need to incorporate those changes.
