The following legacy APIs are still available for use and supported, but there are more recent APIs that allow the same or better functionality.
<h3>Avalara Certs</h3>
This product can be used as a stand-alone certificate management solution, or in conjunction with the Avalara AvaTax product. Customers can be saved in an exempt database, automated communication can be initiated to these customers to collect certificate information. The status of these requests can be monitored, and when customers return certificate data, this certificate data can be queried as well. The API can also pull the images of the saved certificates. This REST API is available only to clients that have signed up separately for an Avalara Certs account, so you will be prompted for login information to access the <a href="https://portal.avatax.com/api/doc/">API Reference Guide</a>. The AvaTax Certs product has been merged with the CertCapture product, and, while the existing Certs API is still available, we recommend you use the more fully-featured <a title="Avalara CertCapture API" href="/api-docs/certcapture-api">CertCapture API</a>.
