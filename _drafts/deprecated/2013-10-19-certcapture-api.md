The Avalara CertCapture web APIs allow for retrieving and/or updating <a href="https://www.certcapture.com">CertCapture</a> data from a remote application. This allows applications to interact with customer and certificate records, and to send automated certificate requests to customers. The API documentation is maintained by the CertCapture engineering team, and can be found <a href="http://docs.certexpress.net/">here</a>.
