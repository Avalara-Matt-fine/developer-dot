Our APIs let you integrate our <a href="http://www.avalara.com/products/avatax">AvaTax</a> sales tax services with almost any financial, ecommerce, point-of-sale, custom-built or third-party application.
<h3>SOAP or REST? You don't have to choose.</h3>
Avalara's API Free Trial now includes access to both our SOAP API SDK, as well as our new REST API.
<h4>REST API</h4>
The REST API gives quick access to many of the powerful features of AvaTax from a REST-based, RPC-oriented API. The API supports both XML and JSON message formats.
<h4>SOAP SDK</h4>
With full testing and support as well as optional time-saving adapters, Avalara's Sales Tax SDK takes the AvaTax services SOAP API, surrounds it with documentation and sample code, and makes it available to development partners. The SDK will make short, efficient work of your integration.
