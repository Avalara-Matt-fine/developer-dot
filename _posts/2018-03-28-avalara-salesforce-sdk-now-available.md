The Avalara Developer Relations team is excited to announce the launch of our new <a href="https://github.com/avadev/AvaTax-SOAP-SF-SDK" target="_blank">Salesforce SDK</a>. 

The Salesforce SDK, written in Salesforce’s Apex code, is available for Avalara’s industry-leading sales tax API. These SDKs will make it easier for Avalara’s Salesforce partners to customize and extend tax integration on salesforce platform, and allow Avalara customers to take advantage of more functionality available from the Avalara platform.

The release of these SDKs coincides with Avalara’s presence at <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/trailheadx" target="_blank">TrailheaDX</a>, the Salesforce developer conference in San Francisco. Please stop by our booth to talk to Avalara team, and join us for a session to learn how we streamline sales tax compliance across your clouds on March 29th at 1:15pm in Meadow Theater.

If you aren’t attending TrailheaDX, but would still like to learn more about the Avalara and Salesforce integration, please join Anagha Sulakhe for an upcoming “ask me anything” <a href="https://developer.avalara.com/resources/webinars/" target="_blank">webinar</a>, where she’ll be talking about common use cases and answering your questions about the SDK.

The Salesforce SDK comes right on the heels of our new official <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Avalara" target="_blank">Avalara Python SDK</a>, which was released last week. Please stay tuned for more releases from the Developer Relations team in 2018!
