If you're a developer working on building tax compliance solutions, then we hope you'll consider coming to CRUSH DC, the premier event for transaction tax professionals. The event is from May 9-11 in Washington, D.C.
 
We have an entire developer track with sessions covering everything from the basics of calculating tax using AvaTax to building connectors for enterprise-level organizations. Not only that, we'll have tech demos, learning labs, knowledge sharing from experts and fellow partners, and plenty of networking.
 
Of course, we realize booking a trip for a three-day event is a big commitment of time and resources, so the Avalara Developer Team wants to help you make your case to the decision makers in your organization. Let's start here: If you sign up for the event before February 28, you'll save $400 on the cost of registration. Be sure to use the DEV10 discount code when you register.
 
We've also put together a handy <strong>[document][1]</strong> that spells out the value you'll receive as a developer if you attend the event. All you have to do is fill in the blanks and send it up the chain of command. It's that easy.
 
And just in case you missed it, you can get a detailed, day-by-day description of the developer track at CRUSH DC, including technical session topics, in this Dec. 6 post on the Avalara Developer Blog.
 
We hope to see you at CRUSH DC!
 
The Avalara Developer Team
