<h3>Sandbox Testing Window</h3>

The AvaTax release schedule includes a preview period where the latest software is available for integration testing in the [AvaTax Sandbox Environment](https://sandbox-rest.avatax.com) two weeks before launching to production. If your engineering team would like a sandbox account for integration testing purposes, please contact your account manager or [open a support ticket](https://help.avalara.com/Directory/Contact_Avalara/Submit_a_Case).

<h3>Case Insensitive Tax Code Search</h3>

The [ListTaxCodes API](/api-reference/avatax/rest/v2/methods/Definitions/ListTaxCodes/) now supports case insensitive search.  This means that the following searches will all be able to return results with capitalization:

```
GET /api/v2/definitions/taxcodes?$filter=description contains sushi
GET /api/v2/definitions/taxcodes?$filter=description startswith sushi
```

The same feature has been extended to other [definitions APIs](/api-reference/avatax/rest/v2/methods/Definitions/).  If you need definitions data from AvaTax, please look around to see what information is available!

<h3>Optional Tax Breakdown by Tax Group</h3>

For customers developing code to work with multiple tax types, you may need to break down taxes by tax type groups.  This new breakdown is called `$include=TaxDetailsByTaxType`.  Try it out when you use [CreateTransaction](/api-reference/avatax/rest/v2/methods/Transactions/CreateTransaction/) for your next tax calculation.

<h3>Tax Content API Improvements</h3>

Avalara's [TaxContent API](/api-reference/avatax/rest/v2/methods/TaxContent/) continues to improve with additional coverage and test suites ensuring reliable tax calculation during sales tax holidays in Puerto Rico, Connecticut, and Canada.  If you're interested in working with the tax content API, contact your account manager or read the [AvaTax Developer Guide chapter on offline tax calculation](/avatax/dev-guide/calculating-tax-offline/tax-content-api/).
