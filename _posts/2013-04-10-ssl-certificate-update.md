Until recently, our development server was using a COMODO SSL certificate. We just updated to a Verisign one to match our production servers - <a href="http://developer.avalara.com/api-docs/best-practices/technical-notes/ssl-certificates" title="SSL Certificates">documentation</a> has also been updated to reflect the new certificate.
