Sales tax is complex and getting more complex. 

For example - when is a bagel taxable or tax-free? What is the threshold for taxing clothing and in what jurisdictions is it subject to tax? How do you keep up with all the changes occurring to sales tax laws? 

What’s the best way to handle that complexity and save your organization from expensive and damaging tax audits?

Our answer? The Avalara API.
