As we expand our global calculation capabilities, we've been talking about what's required to create a truly compliant VAT calculation. Depending on your business requirements, you may want to think about global certification. We only have the G1 and G2 certification available right now, but we'll be adding the tertiary address required for G3 certification soon!
