The Avalara Developer Relations Team is excited to announce it will have a presence at two upcoming events in the local developer community.

Ted Spence, Director of the AvaTax API Team, will make a short presentation on the effectiveness of cached data in a SaaS platform at [New Tech Northwest’s next Seattle event](https://www.newtechnorthwest.com/new-tech-seattle-october-2-2018/), which takes place from 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. PT on Oct. 2 at ThinkSpace, located at 1700 Westlake Ave. N., Suite 200 in Seattle.

Ted will also give an in-depth presentation on how he and the AvaTax API Team created the documentation for Avalara’s sales tax API at [joint meetup organized by Seattle APIs & IPAs and Seattle Write the Docs](https://www.meetup.com/seattle-api/events/254623048/?rv=ea1_v2&_xtd=gatlbWFpbF9jbGlja9oAJDVkZTdhZGNiLWMzOTctNDA1Ni04MDE5LThhNGY4OWY5OTE3Mg). The meetup takes place from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. PT on Oct. 10 at the Best Buy Technology Development Center located at 1000 Denny Way, 8th Floor in Seattle.

We’re excited to be participating in these two events and grateful to the event organizers for giving us a chance to share our experience building our API with the broader developer community.
