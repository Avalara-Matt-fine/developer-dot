Before using the AvaTax API, there are a few basic sales tax principles you need to understand. First and foremost is your organization’s tax profile, which is comprised of three key components:
<ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 1.5em;">
    <li style="text-align: left;">Where your organization is required to collect sales tax, a principle known as nexus</li>
    <li style="text-align: left;">The customers your organization exempts from sales tax</li>
    <li style="text-align: left;">The specific tax rates for the products and services your organization sells</li>
</ul>
Watch the short video above to get a quick, basic understanding of how your organization’s tax profile is determined.
