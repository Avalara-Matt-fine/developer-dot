<h2>Using Unit-based Rates and Codes</h2>

In this post, we will examine unit-based rates and their implementation. Many tax rates and tariffs are ad valorem, which means tax is calculated based on the monetary value of the goods sold or shipped. Rates can also be unit-based. Unit-based rates depend on how much of an item is sold or shipped, for example volume, mass, size, or quantity.

Unit-based rates apply to many goods such as sugar, e-waste and recycling fees for electronics, lodging, and bottles. These rates have a unit of measurement and quantity. Throughout this post, we will refer to units of measurement as UOM.

Letâ€™s show how to use unit-based rates with the AvaTax API.
