The Synopsis :

Transactional Sales Tax is not the easiest thing for an organization to tackle. With millions of addresses, thousands of taxability rules and taxing jurisdictions involved, it can be a daunting task. Weâ€™ll take a whimsical look at some of the more interesting &amp; bizarre sales tax cases, look at the technology that Avalara has built to solve this problem and take a deeper dive into the APIs that are available for developers.
