<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<h3>Document Management with the CertCapture API</h3>
The CertCapture API allows you to create, validate, and store sales tax exemption and reseller certificates.
<h3>What You Can Do</h3>
This API taps into Avalara CertCapture, a powerful tool that helps businesses manage sales tax exemption and reseller certificates. An automated document management system limits audit exposure and ensures that every non-taxable transaction is tracked correctly.
<h3>Get API Key</h3>
To get a username and password, contact your Customer Account Manager or email <a href="mailto:support@certcapture.com">support@certcapture.com</a>.
<h3>Documentation</h3>
Here is the <a href="http://docs.certcapture6xrest.apiary.io/#">CertCapture API Documentation</a> for RESTful APIs for CertCapture 6.X and beyond. This API is designed so that if an error occurs you should get a reasonable worded response and an error code.
