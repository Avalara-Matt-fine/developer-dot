<h2>Account Provisioning and Company Management</h2>
The Onboarding API allows Avalara partners to create customer accounts, company profiles, and user credentials.
<h3>What You Can Do</h3>
This API allows partners to automatically provision individual customer accounts and assist with company profile setup on those accounts, allowing for a quick, automated account setup for these customers.
<h3>Get API Key</h3>
To get access to this API, contact your Customer Account Manager or email <a href="mailto:developer@avalara.com">developer@avalara.com</a>.
<h3>Documentation</h3>
Here is the <a href="http://developer.avalara.com/wp-content/apireference/beta/#onboarding-api">Onboarding API Documentation</a> for the RESTful Onboarding API. This API is designed so that a single operation represents a group of provisioning steps; an account can be provisioned with a company and single location (with associated nexus) and a single admin user with a single POST /accounts.
