<p>We are a full service web design and development company. That means we can help you design and build your first website, or improve the one you already have. We have been in business since 1998, and have years of experience helping our clients find solutions on the web.</p> 
<p>We've worked with e-commerce and e-business to help companies centralize and integrate their data needs. While each integration brings with it the unique challenges of a company's business rules, the principles of integration remain the same, and we've been there to help guide you through it. Many companies selling today have multiple selling channels, including retail locations, call centers, and web stores. ALP can assist you bringing all this data together, providing the kind of real-time, up-to-date data that your web savvy customers are looking for. The ALP team specializes in the use of Microsoft's .NET platform, incorporating programming with your SQL Server or other database, XML, AJAX, Javascript, or other interactive website elements.</p>

<p>Classy Llama has been a Magento Gold Solutions Partner for over 5 years. With over 8 years in business, we've continually outgrown ourselves. Despite having performed over 400 customizations and integrations; ranking in the world's Top 20 Magento Enterprise sales; and contributing our code to Magento 2, one thing still drives us—our relationships. We are proud to serve our clients and partners, such as Avalara, who share our desire to connect and grow. That's why we've not only built over 100 new websites; but also built relationships, as we serve clients on Magento, the best platform for growth.</p>

<p>PBSI focuses mainly upon connecting ERP systems or other enterprise-oriented solutions to Avatax. Since 2000, we've been providing our services to both VAR's and end-users. Our CPA's can assist with the implementation of standard connectors. We can also write custom connectors to meet your specific needs in instances where a standard connector either does not exist, or will not suffice.</p>
<p>Our custom connectors are primarily written in either C# or VB.Net. While most of our experience is derived from the Microsoft Dynamics channel, we would be interested in discussing your non-Microsoft Dynamics requirements as well.</p>
