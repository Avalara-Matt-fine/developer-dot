Designing robust software means planning for every eventuality. To create a world-class product using Communications REST v2, you need to be prepared for when things go wrong - and one of the problems you may face is an outage. Fortunately, there are ways to write your software to gracefully handle an outage.
<br/><br/>
Types of connection issues:
<ul class="dev-guide-list">
  <li>Temporary Outage: Your connection has gone offline and you need to be able to process transactions for a short period of time until the connection is restored</li>
  <li>Intermittent Connection: Your connection works most of the time, but its behavior is unpredictable and occasionally drops unexpectedly</li>
  <li>Unable to Reach REST v2: Your connection is up, but you are unable to reach REST v2 because of a routing problem, a denial-of-service attack on an Internet service provider, or a temporary outage of REST v2</li>
</ul>

These types of outages have similar characteristics, so itâ€™s straightforward to design a single process to handle all of them. Here is how we handle a broken connection:
<ul class="dev-guide-list">
  <li>Detect the dropped connection and prevent a crash</li>
  <li>Retry the transaction</li>
  <li>Recover data using the Commit/Uncommit functionality</li>
  <li>Reconcile transactions after the outage</li>
</ul>
