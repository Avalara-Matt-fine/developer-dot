<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<h3>Landed Cost Rates and Calculation API</h3>
The Landed Cost Â Rate and Calculation API allows to you lookup rates for commodities, and determine estimated landed cost totals for an invoice.

Provide the right rate in real-time for every product in each country, simplifying international tax compliance. Correctly determine all costs associated with customs, duties, shipping, tariffs and taxes for goods sold internationally. Calculate all associated costs and rates in real-time, so there are no surprises at check-out or delivery. More about <a href="https://www.avalara.com/landedcost/">Avalara LandedCost</a>.
