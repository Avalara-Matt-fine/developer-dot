<h2>Finding Your CompanyId</h2>
Some AvaTax APIs (notably <a href="/avatax/api-reference/batch/soap/">BatchSvc</a>) require the use of a CompanyId to refer to a particular company. This is similar to CompanyCode in the TaxSvc API, but is a unique identifier within the Avalara database.
The easiest way to locate your CompanyId is through the Admin Console.
