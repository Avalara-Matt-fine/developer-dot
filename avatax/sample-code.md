<h2>Sample Code and Libraries</h2>
<p>Code samples are designed to help you get started in writing correct code to interface with the Avalara AvaTax APIs. You can do this from a myriad of languages and frameworks and most of them are listed below. You will find officially supported libraries and those that are contributed by our community.</p>
<p>These libraries are open source, and are released as such. If you have located a bug or have questions, please visit the Github repositories that are associated with the sample code and provide feedback there.</p>
