Monthly Developer Webinar: Need to get up and running on Avalara quickly? Here’s how to troubleshoot common challenges with our API!

Learning a new platform can be tough, especially where something as complex as transactional tax is concerned. We get that. The good news is, Avalara’s Engineering Team is here to help. We’d like to invite you and your dev team to attend a 60-minute webinar where some of our best engineers will address the most common issues developers run into with Avalara’s API, including:

•	Authentication  
•	Inconsistent tax results  
•	Result size and filtering  
•	Address resolution, why it's important, and how it relates to tax results  
•	Connection issues  
•	Latency issues  
•	Introduction to resiliency
