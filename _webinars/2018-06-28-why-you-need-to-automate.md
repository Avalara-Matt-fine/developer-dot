Monthly Developer Webinar: Why you need to automate sales tax now and how Avalara’s API can help

Sales tax. Getting it right is crucial to your organization’s success. Unfortunately, it’s complicated, time consuming and painful. That’s the bad news.

Here’s the good news: Avalara has an API that manages all facets of sound tax compliance – everything from calculating tax to managing exemptions to scheduling returns.

If you’re a developer who needs to help your organization automate sales tax, be sure to tune into our latest webinar to learn the basics of Avalara’s API and how it can help you save yourself time and headaches on the sales tax front. The 60-minute webinar will be hosted by our own Ted Spence, Director of the AvaTax API Team and an expert in sales tax compliance.
